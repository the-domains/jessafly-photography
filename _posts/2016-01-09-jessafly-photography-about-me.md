Inspiration can come from anywhere, and it's the artist's job to find it, recognize it, and harness it.

At the age of 12, I was given a very basic film camera, and though the quality was... questionable, it sparked a passion which grew with each passing year.

I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity of being close to photography for a good portion of my life, taking as many courses as possible through High School and University, and working in a photography store for over 10 years.  Very seldom will you see me without a camera of some sort in my hands.

Developing photos for many professional photographers has given me an eye for detail and consistency, exposed me to a wide variety of styles, and changing trends through the years, and most importantly, given me the ability to listen, learn, and create exactly what clients are looking for.

At the end of the day, regardless of the occasion, it is the photographer's job to capture the raw emotion of the moment forever, so that whether it be 3 months, or 3 decades from now, you will be able to look at the image and remember exactly how you felt at that very moment.

Whether it be your Wedding Day, a new addition to the Family, or any other of life's important moments, allow me to capture the raw beauty and emotion of the moment so it can be remembered forever.
